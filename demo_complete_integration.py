Complete integration demo showing how player data works with the existing draft monitoring system.

This demonstrates the full workflow:
1. Load pre-draft player data
2. Initialize draft state with ESPN monitoring capability
3. Simulate draft picks and AI decision making
4. Show how AI agents would use the data
