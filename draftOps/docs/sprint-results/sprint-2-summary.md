## Sub-Sprint 2.3: Draft Strategist Node Implementation

**Specification**: [draftOps/docs/Specifications/sprint-2/draft-specialist-node.md](../Specifications/sprint-2/draft-specialist-node.md)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Branch**: `draft-strategist-node`  
**PR**: #13

### Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the Draft Strategist node as specified for Sprint 2, delivering position-count allocation and strategic rationale for Scout/GM node consumption in future sub-sprints. This component provides the strategic intelligence layer that determines how many candidates to pull from each position based on draft context analysis.

### Core Deliverables ✅

**1. 5-Signal Scoring System**
- **RosterNeed**: Analyzes deficit vs ideal starters + bench plan (normalized [0,1])
- **TierUrgency**: Detects risk of tier cliff before next pick using ADP gap analysis
- **ValueGap**: Identifies falling players with ADP value vs expected slot timing  
- **RunPressure**: Detects recent pick concentration at positions (last 5 picks)
- **Scarcity**: Structural position scarcity factors (TE high, K/DST low, etc.)
- All signals return normalized [0,1] values for consistent weighted scoring

**2. Configurable Budget Allocation**
- **Selection Budget**: Configurable candidate count (default: 15)
- **Weighted Scoring**: Configurable signal weights (RosterNeed: 40%, TierUrgency: 25%, ValueGap: 20%, RunPressure: 10%, Scarcity: 5%)
- **Proportional Distribution**: Score-based allocation with deterministic remainder handling
- **Budget Constraints**: Exact sum enforcement with rebalancing algorithms

**3. Late-Draft Intelligence**
- **DST/K Withholding**: Automatically withholds defense and kicker allocations until final 2-3 rounds
- **Emergency Allocation**: Forces minimum DST/K counts in final rounds if roster gaps exist
- **Configurable Override**: `allow_dst_k_early` option for non-standard strategies
- **Smart Redistribution**: Reallocates withheld counts to skill positions proportionally

**4. Contract-Compliant Output**
- **Exact JSON Format**: `{"player_lookup": {"QB": 0, "RB": 3, "WR": 10, "TE": 2, "DST": 0, "K": 0}, "pick_strategy": "rationale"}`
- **Position Coverage**: All 6 required positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, DST, K) with non-negative integers
- **Strategy Rationale**: 1-3 sentences citing specific signal drivers (need/tier/value/run/scarcity)
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Identical inputs produce identical outputs for testing reliability

### Technical Architecture

**Core Implementation** (`DraftStrategist` class):
- Signal calculation methods for each of the 5 factors
- Weighted scoring with configurable coefficient support  
- Proportional budget allocation with remainder distribution
- Late-draft rule application and constraint handling
- Strategy generation based on dominant signals and context

**Configuration System** (`StrategistConfig`):
- Selection budget customization (5-25+ candidates)
- Signal weight adjustment for different draft philosophies
- Min/max position constraints for specialized strategies
- Secondary sort preferences and late-draft timing controls

**Integration Ready**:
- Compatible with existing `DraftState` and `Player` data structures
- Fallback import handling for testing and standalone operation
- Clean error handling with safe fallback allocation
- Exported through AI core module for downstream consumption

### Validation & Testing

**Contract Compliance Tests**:
- ✅ JSON structure validation (required fields, data types)
- ✅ Budget constraint enforcement (sum equals selection budget)
- ✅ Position coverage verification (all 6 positions present)
- ✅ Strategy format validation (1-3 sentences with signal citations)

**Functional Testing**:
- ✅ Deterministic output verification across multiple runs
- ✅ Different budget configurations (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 candidates)
- ✅ Signal calculation range validation (all values in [0,1])
- ✅ Late-draft rule behavior (DST/K withholding until final rounds)
- ✅ Edge case handling (empty player pools, extreme scenarios)

**Integration Scenarios**:
- ✅ Early draft allocation (focus on skill positions, withhold DST/K)
- ✅ Mid-draft balance (mixed position priorities based on roster gaps)
- ✅ Late-draft completion (include DST/K, fill remaining needs)

### Example Output Scenarios

**Early Draft** (Round 2):
```json
{
  "player_lookup": {"QB": 0, "RB": 3, "WR": 10, "TE": 2, "DST": 0, "K": 0},
  "pick_strategy": "WR tiers are deep and match roster gaps; keep small RB/TE slices for potential tier breaks."
}
```

**Mid Draft** (Round 7): 
```json
{
  "player_lookup": {"QB": 1, "RB": 6, "WR": 7, "TE": 1, "DST": 0, "K": 0},
  "pick_strategy": "RB tier thinning and you're light there; maintain WR coverage; small QB/TE for opportunistic value."
}
```

**Late Draft** (Round 13):
```json
{
  "player_lookup": {"QB": 1, "RB": 4, "WR": 6, "TE": 2, "DST": 1, "K": 1},
  "pick_strategy": "Starters set; balance RB/WR depth and begin shortlisting DST/K so you're not scraping at the end."
}
```

### Key Success Metrics

- For each position with count > 0, Scout selects top candidates by ADP ranking  
- Merged candidate pool of exactly `SELECTION_BUDGET` players for GM evaluation
- Strategy rationale provides context for GM decision weighting

**GM Node Integration** (After Scout):
