# Player Data Integration

This document describes the player data integration system implemented for Sprint 2.

## Overview

The player data integration system loads pre-draft player data from CSV files and makes it available to AI agents during draft decision making. This enables the AI to make informed recommendations based on ADP rankings, fantasy projections, and player statistics.

## Key Components

### 1. Player Data Model (`data_loader.py`)

- **Player dataclass**: Represents a draftable player with all relevant data
  - Core identification: name, team, position
  - Rankings: ADP rank, position rank, average ADP, standard deviation
  - Projections: fantasy points, statistical projections
  - Position-specific stats for analysis

### 2. Data Loader (`PlayerDataLoader`)

Parses three CSV files:
- `ADP_Fantasy_Football_Rankings_2025.csv` - Consensus ADP and rankings
- `Non_DEF_stats_ppr_6ptPaTD.csv` - Offensive player projections
- `DEF_stats_ppr_6ptPaTD.csv` - Defensive team projections

**Key Features:**
- Merges data sources by player name matching
- Handles defenses as DST position players
- Validates data consistency and logs summary

### 3. DraftState Integration

Extended existing `DraftState` class to support player database:
- `load_player_database()` - Loads Player objects for AI queries
- `get_player(name)` - Name-based player lookup with fuzzy matching
- `get_available_players_by_position()` - Positional filtering
- `get_top_available_players()` - ADP-ranked recommendations

**Architecture:**
- ESPN player IDs track draft state (who's been picked)
- Player database provides rich data for AI decisions
- Name resolution bridges ESPN picks to player data

## Usage Example

```python
from draftOps.data_loader import load_player_data
from draftOps.src.websocket_protocol.state.draft_state import DraftState

# Load player data
players = load_player_data()

# Initialize draft state
draft_state = DraftState("league_id", "team_id", 12, 16)
draft_state.load_player_database(players)

# AI can now make informed decisions
top_qbs = draft_state.get_available_players_by_position('QB')
recommendation = top_qbs[0]  # Best available QB

print(f"Recommend {recommendation.name}: ADP {recommendation.adp_avg}, "
      f"Proj {recommendation.fantasy_points} pts")
```

## Data Coverage

Successfully loads:
- **300 total players** across all positions
- **271 players** with fantasy point projections  
- **All positions**: QB (37), RB (80), WR (100), TE (38), K (18), DST (27)
- **Complete data fields**: ADP, rankings, projections, stats

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests verify:
- Data loading correctness
- Player object structure
- DraftState integration
- Positional queries
- Data validation

Run tests: `python -m pytest draftOps/test_player_data.py`

## Integration Benefits

1. **Rich AI Context**: Players include ADP, projections, and detailed stats
2. **Real-time Queries**: Fast positional and value-based filtering
3. **Draft Awareness**: Separates ESPN tracking from player data
4. **Flexible Matching**: Name-based resolution with fuzzy matching
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All draftable positions with full data

## Files Modified/Created

**New Files:**
- `draftOps/data_loader.py` - Core data loading functionality
- `draftOps/test_player_data.py` - Unit tests
- `demo_complete_integration.py` - Integration demonstration

**Modified Files:**
- `draftOps/src/websocket_protocol/state/draft_state.py` - Added player database support

## Next Steps

The system is ready for Sprint 3 AI integration. The loaded player data provides everything needed for AI agents to make informed draft recommendations:

- Player rankings and consensus ADP
- Fantasy point projections  
- Position-specific statistics
- Team information
- Easy querying by position and value

AI agents can now focus on strategic decision making rather than data lookup.
